# Time-Lapse-Photo

Takes a time lapse (any video will work really, but it's made for time lapses) and turns it into a photo by taking a vertical strip from every few frames and layering them side by side together. It works especially well/looks best with day to night time lapses. The photo will be saved as "video directory".jpg

I included a .mov and a .jpg I made from it as an example of what the program does.

### Getting Started

Use the given TimeLapsePhoto.exe file with one argument: the directory of a .mp4 or .mov file


### Building

If you want to build it from the main.cpp file, you'll need [opencv] (https://opencv.org/releases.html) for C++. From there, you'll probably have to mess around with the include directory and everything else that accompanies using libraries. I won't get into it here. 


### Acknowledgements

I didn't make the [time lapse] (https://www.videvo.net/video/day-to-night-time-lapse-lake-and-stars/2619/) I put up here as an example.

Hopefully it's all pretty straightforward! Let me know if you have trouble with it, and thanks for taking the time to look through everything here!
